The purpose of this PowerShell script was to create a custom solution that simplifies creating directories when inputting logs in the Tech Support Teams Drive Folder. There are three primary functions.

1) To open up FileZilla via Command Line for a designated user name on the FTP.

2) To create a folder in the designated logs directory. 

3) To combine these two functions.

The 'FolderOnly' script will only perform function 2.
